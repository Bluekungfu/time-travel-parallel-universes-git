When I checked into my hotel room, I saw a small gift-wrapped package sitting squarely in the center of my bed. A small card on top of the package had my name on it, but was otherwise blank. I tore open the wrapping and found a smartphone inside. Oddly enough, although I follow a lot of tech blogs and I'm pretty knowledgable about the latest models, the one in front of me looked completely unfamiliar. It came with no instruction booklet, no accessories, not even a power cord. It was a typical glass brick-style phone, except that it had only a single button on it. After turning the phone over several times to make sure there were no other controls, I tapped the sole button. The screen lit up immediately, and on the display a few icons appeared. I tapped one that looked like a camera.
